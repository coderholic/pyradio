# Default encoding
# This is the encoding used by default when reading data provided by
# a station (such as song title, etc.) If reading said data ends up
# in an error, 'utf-8' will be used instead.
#
# A valid encoding list can be found at:
#   https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
# replacing 2.7 with specific version:
#   3.0 up to current python version.

# Connection timeout
# PyRadio will wait for this number of seconds to get a station/server
# message indicating that playback has actually started.
# If this does not happen (within this number of seconds after the
# connection is initiated), PyRadio will consider the station
# unreachable, and display the "Failed to connect to: [station]"
# message.

# Valid values: 5 - 60
# Default value: 10
