## Requirements

* python 2.6+/3.2+
* python-pip
* mpv, mplayer or vlc installed and in your path.
* socat (if you wish to use MPV)

## Installation via pip

This is the simplist method for installing PyRadio.

The first thing is to make sure MPV, MPlayer or VLC are installed and are in the
PATH. To check this, go in your favorite terminal and make sure thiese programs
are launched when you type "mpv", "mplayer" or "cvlc".

#### MacOSX

MPlayer is one of the available packages provided by [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew).

But it is not the case of VLC. Nevertheless, pyradio will also work with the binary of the application [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html).

You simply can add a symbolic link to the executable as follows (this link must of course be in your PATH):

    ln -s /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC cvlc

The second step is to use pip to install the python package:

    pip install pyradio

#### Linux

	pip install pyradio

## Building from source

#### MaxOSX and Linux

	python setup.py build

The second step is to install the build:

	sudo python setup.py install

## Shell commands

    $ pyradio -h

    usage: main.py [--help] [--stations <path>] [--random] [--add] [--list]

    Console radio player

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.

    -r, --random          Start and play a random station.
    -a, --add             Add station to list.
    -l, --list            List of added stations.
    -d, --debug           Debug mode (pyradio.log created).
                          To be attached with any bug report.

## Player default volume

### mpv

mpv uses profiles to customize its behavior.

Users can define a profile called "**[pyradio]**" in mpv's configuration file (e.g. *~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf*) and pyradio will use it when playing.

Example:

    [pyradio]
    volume-max=300
    volume=50

### mplayer

mplayer uses profiles to customize its behavior as well.

Users can define a profile called "**[pyradio]**" in mplayers's configuration file (e.g. *~/.mplayer/config*) and pyradio will use it when playing.

Example:

    [pyradio]
    softvol=yes
    volstep=2
    volume=28

### vlc

vlc by default saves the volume, so no customization is necessary.
